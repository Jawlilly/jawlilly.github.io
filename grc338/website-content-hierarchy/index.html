                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>Its about games, but also, its not! We strive to be a welcoming and safe space for a vibrant community. Our hope is to provide an opportunity to laugh, think differently, and play! We want you to log-out out of the day to day, put your phones down and spend some quality time with friends, co-workers, and family. We come from backgrounds of science, education, and tinkering. We’re lifelong learners, and we want to help facilitate others who are the same. Games are our way of doing that. The board game industry is in its golden age. With 5,000 new titles coming out every year, our goal is to provide you with a special curated experience. That experience would not be complete without delicious food, drinks, and ambiance. .</p>

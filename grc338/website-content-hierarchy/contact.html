                    <h3>What we are doing in the times of COVID 19</h3>
                    <p>Our plan has always been to open our doors cautiously, and slowly, reassessing everyday; but now, more than ever, we want to make it abundantly clear that in addition to the safety rules and procedures themselves, we will be vigilantly enforcing these rules and procedures. Safety protocol is pointless if there's no accountability. We feel confident that this is the only responsible way to go forward. </p>

                    <p>WHAT WE ASK OF YOU:
Reservations are strongly encouraged. 

Maximum parties of 8. 

Masks  are required anytime guests are not eating or drinking. 

Guests must sanitize hands before exploring the game shelves, and only two games are allowed at tables at a time (you can play as many as you like!). 

    Guest should not put games back. We’ll grab them from your table for quarantine.                    </p>

<p>HOW WE ARE ENSURING SAFETY: 
Our capacity has been reduced two thirds. 

We have built and installed 7 ft acrylic barriers between all tables (they’re pretty neat!).  

Staff has been trained using best business practices and CDC guild lines. 

Sanitizer is provided at every table as well as high traffic surface areas. 

All games are either quarantined for 72 hrs after use or when possible washed or sanitized. 

Temperature checks are required for all staff before shifts. 

General cleaning and sanitizing schedules have increased in frequency and detail. </p>
